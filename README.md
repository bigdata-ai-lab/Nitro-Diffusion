### Nitro Diffusion

Welcome to Nitro Diffusion - the first Multi-Style Model trained from scratch! This is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on three artstyles simultaniously while keeping each style separate from the others. This allows for high control of mixing, weighting and single style use.
Use the tokens **_archer style, arcane style or modern diseny style_** in your prompts for the effect. You can also use more than one for a mixed style like in the examples down below:

#### Prompt and settings for Tony Stark:
**(redshift style) robert downey jr as ironman Negative prompt: glasses helmet**
_Steps: 40, Sampler: DPM2 Karras, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 908018284, Size: 512x704_

#### Prompt and settings for the Ford Mustang:
**redshift style Ford Mustang**
_Steps: 20, Sampler: DPM2 Karras, CFG scale: 7, Seed: 579593863, Size: 704x512_

### ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This model can be used just like any other Stable Diffusion model. For more information,
please have a look at the [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion).

You can also export the model to [ONNX](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/onnx), [MPS](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/optimization/mps) and/or [FLAX/JAX]().

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_id = "nitrosocke/nitro-diffusion"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

prompt = "archer arcane style magical princess with golden hair"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

image.save("./magical_princess.png")
```

This model was trained using the diffusers based dreambooth training by ShivamShrirao using prior-preservation loss and the _train-text-encoder_ flag in 11.000 steps.
